"description": "This listing is for an Octopus cup lined with Turquoise Blue and is ready to ship. nnnFeaturing an illustration of an octopus from a vintage natural history book, the Octopus Wine Cup is the perfect vessel to hold a serving of your favorite vino. Holding approximately 8-10 ounces, each cup is individually thrown on the potter&#39;s wheel and fired in an electric kiln with glazes mixed by hand in my glaze lab. The exterior glaze has a satin finish whose color can range from a light tan to a soft cream, perfectly complimenting the high gloss of the brightly-colored interior glaze. nnPlease keep in mind that each piece is made by hand; therefore, variations do occur. The images shown represent a typical wine cup of this style, not the exact one that you will receive. nnThese cups are durable and are microwave and dishwasher safe. Do not heat shock ceramic ware; going from extreme heat to extreme cold or vice versa can shock ceramics and cause cracking.",

See photo for comparison to the authentic oak barrel version I have available separately)nnDescription:nnThis is my SMALLER version of my Blantons display (WITHOUT horseshoe).  Measures approximately 15&quot; x 7.5&quot;nnCustom hand built display for Blanton&#39;s / Blantons bourbon cork stoppers.  Made from a solid wood round.  Made to imitate the charring found on the original oak whiskey barrels with the black version or available also in a stained version with burned edges (your choice).  Back has felt bumpers / feet to protect your surfaces.  Photo is of one of my finished pieces.  Since these are hand made, each one will have it&#39;s own characteristics and no two will look exactly alike and will differ slightly from the photo. This is NOT a authentic barrel head.  It is made to look like a mini version of the real thing, but is a much less expensive option. nnMade to accommodate the 8 collectable cork stoppers found in the Blanton&#39;s full sets.  Can also be used to display any other 7/8&quot; diameter stoppers of your choice.nnPlease allow 3 to 4 weeks with my current build schedule estimation as I have many large and small projects on my order list under construction. Sometimes I can complete items much sooner, depending on my current schedule or feel free to ask me if I have any currently ready to ship out.nnI have more of these in production and available soon. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.",

"policy_welcome": "------------------n----- FAQs -----n------------------nnn----- GENERAL FAQs -----nu25baWhat is a digital printable file?nA digital printable file is a file (JPG or PDF) of your print that you can either print yourself or have printed. This shop does not sell any physical prints -- just the files.nnu25baWhy would I want a digital printable file instead of a physical print?nDigital prints = print at your convenience, as many times as you want! No shipping fees, and no waiting days and days for your print to arrive. Print the size you want (within the same aspect ratio), on the material you want (paper, board, metal, etc). Because the file is emailed to you, you can have the final product in your hands much faster than if purchasing a hard-copy! Need it really fast? Print at a one-hour photo lab - you could potentially have your order printed the same day you order it! Also, create photo gifts with your digital prints, add them to photo books, share on social media, etc!nnu25baDo you ever offer discounts or coupon codes?nYes, but you must &quot;like&quot; me on Facebook to receive promotions & sales for my shop, as well as to photo labs!nfacebook.com/MAonEtsynnu25baCan the shop call me if I have questions?n{PRINTS} by MA Design can be contacted via Etsy Conversation. The shop DOES NOT communicate via telephone (call or text).nnu25baMy print lab is asking for a Print Release form. What is that, and how do I get it?nFirst of all, a print release form is sent with every single order - check the email you received with your order. A Print Release Form grants the buyer permission (a release) from the print owner (the shop) to print images provided. It does not include rights to edit or alter the image, sell them, etc. That right remains with the print owner (the shop).nnn----- INSTANT DOWNLOAD FAQS -----nu25baWhat exactly is an Instant Download digital printable file?nInstant Download digital printable files are prints that will be delivered to you via Etsy and that you print on your own. What you receive is exactly what is seen in the previews. No changes can be made since these files are pre-loaded into Etsy and sent to the customer from Etsy (not from the shop). Check out this article for more info on Instant Downloads: https://www.etsy.com/help/article/3949nu2022 Customer will receive an email from Etsy with their download link as soon as payment clearsnu2022 Due to the nature of instant download digital images, all sales are final and no refunds and/or exchanges will be given.nnu25baI like one of your Instant Download digital printable files, but I want to make some changes to it. Can that be done?nNo changes can be made to Instant Downloads. But for almost every Instant Download that I have in my shop, there is a custom version available as well!nnu25baWhere are Instant Downloads sent? Can I give the shop a different email address to use?nInstant Downloads are sent via Etsy (not the shop) to the email address linked to the customer&#39;s Etsy account. No other email address can be used since it&#39;s sent directly from Etsy. Please make sure the email address you use for Etsy is working and you can access it.

Can you make any suggestions?nLighter colors (for the text) works best against the dark chalkboard background. For samples of different color scheme examples, I suggest this website: http://design-seeds.com/ If you find one you like, send me the link.nnu25baI&#39;m going to use my digital print as a photo prop. Do you have any suggestions?nIf framing a photo prop, place the print in front of the glass to help reduce the glare. Definitely make sure that a non-glossy finish is chosen when printing to help reduce glare.nnn----- PRINT LAB FAQS -----nu25baWhat will it cost to print a digital printable file?nThe cost will depend on a LOT of factors -- the print lab, media (poster, poster board, etc), size, how fast you need it, if you choose a local one-hour lab or have to pay for shipping, if you use coupon codes or sales, etc.nnu25baWhen uploading my image to a print lab, I have different upload speeds to choose from. Which should I choose?nIf you&#39;re given a choice of upload speeds when uploading your print to a photo lab website, NEVER CHOOSE THE FAST OPTION! This will reduce the quality of the print since they are very large. By default, the fast upload option is often selected, so make sure you choose the option for large prints.n**This is especially true for Walmart.com! Walmart.com automatically has the &quot;fast upload&quot; option selected, which will reduce the quality of the print. Make sure you check the &quot;Large print upload&quot; option instead.nnu25baI tried downloading my digital print to my phone, but it&#39;s not working correctly. Please help!nud83dudcf5 DON&#39;T DOWNLOAD TO YOUR PHONE! The files are large (since they&#39;re high-resolution), and sometimes when saving to a phone the phone converts it into a smaller file.

Make sure you check the &quot;Large print upload&quot; option instead.nnu25baI can&#39;t print my digital print at home, but don&#39;t know which photo lab to choose. Can you suggest one?nThere are many options for printing your digital files, but here are a few suggestions:nnu2022 Costco is by far the most popular store that my customers choose to print their digital prints (and one of my favorites!). They have numerous options at very reasonable prices! &quot;Poster Prints&quot; and &quot;Poster Boards&quot; are two favorites! Poster Boards are a great way to display photo props, wedding signs, birthday boards, anniversary boards, etc. with no frame needed! And most of Costco&#39;s printing options are available in one hour (depending on the location)!!! People always appear to be very pleased with the result from &gt; printing, and I myself have used them to print my own prints and poster boards!nThe only drawback is you must have a Costco membership to be able to print there.nnu2022 Mpix.com is one of my favorite places for printing digital images, especially photos, faux-chalkboards, wall art, etc. The quality is fantastic, yet the price is reasonable. They have many different options when it comes to paper and finishes (true black & white, pearl finish, metallic finish, etc.). To print your digital file, all you need to do is upload your JPG to their website. The only drawback is that you have to wait a few days for your prints to arrive in the mail. Before ordering, be sure to look online for coupon codes! :)nnu2022 VistaPrint.com is another very popular and reliable online retailer for printing everything from invitations to posters! Always search for a coupon code before placing your purchase -- there are a ton available online, you just have to find them!nnu2022 Shutterfly.com and Snapfish.com are very popular and reliable online resources for printing digital files, especially cards and invitations. One of the best parts is that they trim the cards for you and offer free matching envelopes! Your stationery will turn out looking very professional without a hefty price tag.nPlus Shutterfly always seems to be having a sale! The only drawback, like Mpix, is that you have to wait for your order to arrive in the mail.nnu2022 One-hour photo labs also offer a variety of printing options and price ranges, with the convenience of fast printing. You may be limited to only glossy finishes, and have to purchase envelopes separately if you&#39;re printing invitations. But if you need something fast, one-hour photo labs are definitely a good option! Some examples are Costco, Samu2019s Club, Walmart, Wallgreens, Rite Aid, etc.nnu2022 Office supply stores are also a great option! Some require a PDF for printing rather than a JPG, so please check this before placing your order -- if you need a PDF just let me know and I can give you that format instead.n**Staples can print B&W prints at a VERY reasonable price!!!!nnn----- INVITATION FAQS -----nu25baI need some help with printing invitations. Please help!nIt is best to print invitations as actual invitations so that you receive envelopes, rather than just printing the invites as a photograph. Suggestions of print labs include Shutterfly.com and VistaPrint.com.nnu25baHow do I print an invitation?nIt is best to print invitations as actual invitations so that you receive envelopes, rather than just printing the invites as a photograph. Some suggestions of print labs that print invitations and stationary include Shutterfly.com, Zazzle.com, and VistaPrint.com.nnu25ba I want to print cards through Vista Print, but their dimensions are 5.59&quot; x 4.33&quot;.n5.59&quot; x 4.33&quot; is the same aspect ratio as 5x7&quot;, so any 5x7&quot; digital printable file should work just fine!n*This shop is not responsible for printing errors caused by the buyer not setting up their print correctly when printed.nnnnnn--------------------------------------------------n----- ADDITIONAL SHOP POLICES -----n--------------------------------------------------nnn---- GENERAL POLICIES -----n-------------------------------------nn---- HOURS OF OPERATION -----n{PRINTS} by MA Design operates from 8am - 5pm EST, Monday - Friday (although emails may be responded to outside this time frame since it can be done from a phone).
